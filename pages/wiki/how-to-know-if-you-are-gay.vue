                Learning how to know if you are gay is ultimately about listening to your heart, paying attention to your genuine attractions, and being honest with yourself about your feelings. There's no single test, timeline, or experience that definitively answers this question – only your own self-reflection and understanding can provide that clarity.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Remember that questioning your sexuality is completely normal and healthy. Whether you discover that you're gay, straight, bisexual, or identify with another orientation, what matters most is that you're being true to yourself and treating yourself with compassion throughout the process.
              </p>
              <p class="font-semibold text-purple-900">
                Your feelings are valid, your journey is unique, and you deserve love and acceptance – especially from yourself.
