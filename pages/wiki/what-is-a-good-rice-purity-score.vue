            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 border-b-2 border-blue-200 pb-2" style="line-height: 1.4 !important;">What is the Rice Purity Test?</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Before diving into what is a good rice purity score, it's important to understand the background of the Rice Purity Test. Originally developed by Rice University in the United States, the Rice Purity Test is a self-assessment comprising a series of questions designed to measure an individual's level of "purity" based on life experiences. The questions cover topics like love, drinking, illegal activities, and sexual experiences. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating greater "purity" or a more conservative life experience.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 border-b-2 border-blue-200 pb-2" style="line-height: 1.4 !important;">What is a Good Rice Purity Score? There is No Standard Answer</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              After completing the test, many people ask: <strong>What is a good rice purity score?</strong> The truth is, there is no absolute "good" or "bad" when it comes to your Rice Purity Score. Everyone's lifestyle, upbringing, and life choices differ, so it's impossible to judge a person solely based on a number.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- High Score Section -->
          <div class="mb-8">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-green-800" style="line-height: 1.4 !important;">What Does a High Score Mean?</h3>
            <div class="bg-green-50 border-l-4 border-green-400 p-4 rounded-r-lg">
              <p>
                If your Rice Purity Score is high, say above 90, it suggests that you have had relatively few experiences in areas like drinking, smoking, drugs, love, or sexual activities. This is neither inherently good nor bad; it simply reflects your cautious or conservative lifestyle choices or upbringing.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <!-- Low Score Section -->
          <div class="mb-8">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-orange-800" style="line-height: 1.4 !important;">What Does a Low Score Mean?</h3>
            <div class="bg-orange-50 border-l-4 border-orange-400 p-4 rounded-r-lg">
              <p>
                On the other hand, if your score is low, such as between 30-40, it generally means you have had a rich variety of experiences in love, relationships, parties, and other adventures. A low score does not equate to being "bad." Instead, it signifies diverse life experiences and an adventurous spirit. There is no right or wrong path in life.
              </p>
