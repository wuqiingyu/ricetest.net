              "Which ear is the gay ear?" This question has circulated for decades, referring to the belief that wearing an earring in a specific ear signals one's sexual orientation. While this concept was more prominent in the 1970s and 1980s, many people today still wonder about the origins and current relevance of this cultural symbol. Let's explore the history, truth, and modern perspective on this enduring question.
            </p>

          <!-- The Traditional Answer -->
          <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 border-b-2 border-purple-200 pb-2" style="line-height: 1.4 !important;">The Traditional Answer: Right Ear</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              According to the longstanding cultural belief, <strong>the right ear was traditionally considered the "gay ear."</strong> This led to the popular phrase that many people from older generations might remember:
            </p>
            
            <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 rounded-r-lg mb-4">
              <p class="text-blue-800 font-semibold text-center text-lg">
                "Left is right, right is wrong"
              </p>
              <p class="text-blue-700 text-sm mt-2 text-center">
                Meaning: Left ear = straight, Right ear = gay
              </p>
            </div>

            <p class="mb-4">
              This saying was used as a memory device to remember which ear supposedly indicated which sexual orientation. However, it's crucial to understand that this was never a universal rule or accurate indicator of someone's sexuality.

                The answer to "which ear is the gay ear?" is both simple and complex. Traditionally, the right ear was associated with gay men, but this was never a reliable indicator and has little relevance today.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                In modern times, earring placement is purely a matter of personal style and preference. Whether you're gay, straight, bisexual, or identify with any other orientation, you should feel free to wear earrings in whichever ear (or both ears) feels right for you.

              <p class="font-semibold text-purple-900">
                Remember: Your accessories don't define your sexuality, and your sexuality doesn't need to be communicated through secret codes. Be yourself, express yourself authentically, and wear your earrings with pride!
